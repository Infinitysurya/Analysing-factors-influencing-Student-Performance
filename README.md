# Analysing-factors-influencing-Student-Performance
In this project, I have analysed various factors influencing student performance to check which factor plays the most important role

● Collected data from Kaggle and cleaned for analysis.

● Exploratory data analysis and visualization to gain a better
understanding of the data.

● Plotted correlation matrix to select optimal features.

● Fit a linear regression model using scikit-learn for 80-20 train-test
split. Obtained r2-score 0.98 for test data.
